                Majority of commercial banks lower their base lending rates to single digit
            </h3>
            
            <article>
                KATHMANDU, March 24: Majority of commercial banks have lowered their base interest rates on loans to single digit after they were overwhelmed with excess loanable funds.

                According to the financial reports unveiled by the class A financial institutions, 17 out of 20 commercial banks have maintained their interest rates on loans below 10 percent per annum. Three commercial banks including Kumari Bank, Prime Commercial Bank and Himalayan Bank, however, are found reluctant to reduce their base interest rates to single digit. The base interest rate of Himalayan Bank is the highest at 10.10 percent per annum.

                Standard Chartered Bank Nepal Limited (SCBNL) and Rastriya Banijya Bank (RBB) have fixed their base interest rates at less than 8 percent per annum. While the base rate on loans of the SCBNL is 7.52 percent that of the RBB is 7.62 percent.

                The notable drop in the interest rates has come after Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) became lenient in the issue through the first review of the monetary policy for 2023/24 in the first week of December. The NRB reduced the bank rate from 7.5 percent to 7 percent, while the policy rate was also revised to 5.5 percent from 6.5 percent.
